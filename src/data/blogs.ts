      <p>Deciding the <strong>best time to visit Kashi and Ayodhya</strong> is the first step toward a successful pilgrimage. Both cities carry a unique energy that shifts with the seasons and the Hindu lunar calendar.</p>
      
      <h3>Winter (October to March): The Peak Season</h3>
      <p>Undoubtedly, the winter months are the most pleasant for exploring the narrow alleys of Varanasi and the expansive temple complexes of Ayodhya. The temperatures range from 5°C to 15°C, making day-long sightseeing comfortable. This is also the season for major festivals like Dev Deepawali in Kashi, where every ghat is lit with millions of diyas.</p>
      
      <h3>Summer (April to June): The Spiritual Retreat</h3>
      <p>Summers in Uttar Pradesh can be intense, with temperatures often crossing 40°C. However, for those seeking fewer crowds and a more meditative experience, this can be an ideal time. We recommend scheduling temple visits for early mornings and late evenings.</p>
      
      <h3>Monsoon (July to September): The Vedic Vibe</h3>
      <p>The rains bring a lush, green beauty to the banks of the Sarayu in Ayodhya. While the Ganga levels in Varanasi may prevent boat rides during heavy rains, the atmosphere remains profoundly spiritual. The sound of rain against ancient temple walls creates a Vedic ambiance like no other.</p>

      <p>The Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Mandir has transformed <strong>Ayodhya</strong> into a global spiritual beacon. Planning a visit in 2025 requires an understanding of the new site layout and security protocols.</p>
      
      <h3>Darshan Timings and Slots</h3>
      <p>General Darshan is open from 6:30 AM to 9:30 PM. We recommend reaching the entry point by 7:00 AM for the smoothest experience. Electronic items, including mobile phones, are strictly prohibited inside the main complex but secure lockers are provided.</p>
      
      <h3>Must-Visit Beyond the Main Temple</h3>
      <p>While the Ram Mandir is the highlight, do not miss Hanuman Garhi, where it is traditional to offer prayers before visiting Lord Ram, and the Kanak Bhawan, known for its divine architecture and idols.</p>
